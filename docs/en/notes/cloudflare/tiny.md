# Building a URL Shortening Service with Cloudflare Pages and Astro

> AI-generated summary

<!-- excerpt -->

In this article, we will introduce how to build a URL shortening service using Cloudflare Pages and Astro. This article covers environment setup, integration of Astro and Cloudflare, setting up Cloudflare KV, and implementing and deploying pages. By following these steps, you will be able to build a fully functional URL shortening service.

## Prerequisite

- Docker
- VSCode
- Cloudflare account

## Setup Environment

I use VSCode dev container

Press F1 in VSCode

Select `Dev Containers: Add Dev Container Configuration Files...`

Choose a `node.js` environment:

![dev_container.webp](https://cdn.miksin.art/miksinote/img/notes/cloudflare/tiny/dev_container.webp)

Here are the `devcontainer.json` and `Dockerfile` I used

```json
{
  "name": "Untitled Node.js project",
  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "remoteUser": "node",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/common-utils:2": {}
  },
  "forwardPorts": [
    4321, // for astro dev server
    8976  // for wrangler login
  ],
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "astro-build.astro-vscode",
        "svelte.svelte-vscode",
        "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
        "GitHub.copilot",
        "GitHub.copilot-chat"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The `forwardPorts` are needed for development later

```Dockerfile
FROM node:22

# Install basic development tools
RUN apt update && apt install -y less man-db sudo

# Ensure default `node` user has access to `sudo`
ARG USERNAME=node
RUN echo $USERNAME ALL=\(root\) NOPASSWD:ALL > /etc/sudoers.d/$USERNAME \
    && chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/$USERNAME

# Set `DEVCONTAINER` environment variable to help with orientation
ENV DEVCONTAINER=true
```

For other VSCode dev containers, you can refer to [another article](/notes/vitepress/01_installation)

## Setting up Astro

After entering the container, use the official tool to generate Astro files

```bash
npm create astro@latest

# dir   Where should we create your new project?
#        ./astro

# tmpl   How would you like to start your new project?
#        A basic, minimal starter

# deps   Install dependencies?
#        Yes

#  git   Initialize a new git repository?
#        Yes
```

The generated files are in the `/astro` folder, I moved all the contents out

```bash
mv astro/* .
rm -rf astro
```

Try to start the dev server, you should see the initial screen

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Cloudflare Integration

Add Cloudflare integration

```bash
npx astro add cloudflare
```

It should automatically configure the files for us, but we still need to add some settings:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  output: "server",
  adapter: cloudflare({
    platformProxy: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  }),
})
```

Our URL shortening service is not a purely static website, so set `output: 'server'` to make Astro default to SSR

The `platformProxy.enabled` is to allow us to use Cloudflare features locally

For more details, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/#platformproxy)

### Setting up Cloudflare KV

Our URL shortening service needs to store short and URL key-value pairs, here we use `Cloudflare KV`

#### Login to wrangler

`wrangler` is Cloudflare's official tool, let's log in first

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

It should pop up a browser, but it won't automatically pop up in the dev container, we need to manually copy the URL and paste it into the browser

![wrangler_grant.webp](https://cdn.miksin.art/miksinote/img/notes/cloudflare/tiny/wrangler_grant.webp)

After agreeing, the page will try to redirect back to port 8976, which may fail

But we have already opened this port in `devcontainer.json`, so it should log in successfully

#### Create KV Namespace

Create a namespace to store our data, name it `SHORT_TO_URL`

```bash
npx wrangler@latest kv:namespace create SHORT_TO_URL
```

You should get an ID from the terminal, add it to `wrangler.toml`

```
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "SHORT_TO_URL"
id = "[YOUR ID HERE]"
```

To make the development environment recognize `SHORT_TO_URL`, add `env.d.ts`

```
/// <reference types="astro/client" />

type KVNamespace = import("@cloudflare/workers-types").KVNamespace;
type ENV = {
  SHORT_TO_URL: KVNamespace;
};

// use a default runtime configuration (advanced mode).
type Runtime = import("@astrojs/cloudflare").Runtime<ENV>;
declare namespace App {
  interface Locals extends Runtime {}
}
```

Refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-an-astro-site/#use-bindings-in-your-astro-application)

A `.wrangler` folder appeared, it seems unnecessary to add it to version control, add it to `.gitignore`:

```
.wrangler/
```

### Implementing Pages

I have three endpoints:

- `src/pages/index.astro`
  - Home page. Static, prepare a form for users to input URL and submit
- `src/pages/shorten.ts`
  - Receive URL and return the shortened slug
- `src/pages/[slug].ts`
  - Receive slug and redirect to the stored URL

#### `src/pages/index.astro`

This page basically needs an interactive form, it doesn't need to be SSR, we add `prerender = true` to specify

Refer to [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/routing-reference/#switch-to-server-mode)

```astro
---
export const prerender = true;
---
```

I use Svelte to implement the form

```bash
npx astro add svelte
```

The CSS part is omitted, the main thing to note is that in `index.astro`, we need to specify the component as `client:load` to make it interactive

```jsx
<Form client:load />
```

The form content is similar to normal front-end implementation, refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/miksin/tiny/blob/main/src/components/Form.svelte)

#### `src/pages/shorten.ts`

This endpoint is used to receive the URL and return the shortened slug

I use md5 encryption, so install the package first:

```bash
npm i -S js-md5
```

After calculating the slug, we can get the previously set `SHORT_TO_URL` from `locals`

```typescript
import type { APIRoute } from "astro"
import { md5 } from "js-md5"

const charset = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"

export const POST: APIRoute = async ({ request, locals }) => {
  try {
    const body = await request.json()
    const url = new URL(body.url)
    let hashed = Number.parseInt(md5.hex(url.href), 16)
    let slug = ""
    for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      slug += charset[hashed % charset.length]
      hashed = Math.floor(hashed / charset.length)
    }
    const { SHORT_TO_URL } = locals.runtime.env
    await SHORT_TO_URL.put(slug, url.href)
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ slug }))
  }
  catch (e) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: "Invalid URL" }), { status: 400 })
  }
}
```

#### `src/pages/[slug].ts`

This endpoint needs to handle the received slug, query the previously stored URL, and provide redirection

```typescript
import type { APIRoute } from "astro"

export const GET: APIRoute = async ({ params, locals, redirect }) => {
  const slug: string = params.slug ?? ""
  const { SHORT_TO_URL } = locals.runtime.env
  const url = await SHORT_TO_URL.get(slug)
  if (!url) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: "Not found" }), { status: 404 })
  }
  return redirect(url, 301)
}
```

## Deployment

We can set the build and deploy commands in `package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "deploy": "astro build && wrangler pages deploy",
  }
}
```

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Success! But my domain name is too long, it didn't shorten at all ðŸ™ƒ

#### Questions

I originally set it to use the deploy feature included in Cloudflare Pages, but using only this feature does not automatically generate a worker.
That means only static pages are deployed successfully (404 will be displayed for others)

It seems that only using `wrangler pages deploy` from local works
